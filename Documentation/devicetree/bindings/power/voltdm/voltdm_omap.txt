Texas Instruments OMAP compatible voltage domain description

This binding uses [1] and describes the voltage domain devices
typically used on Texas Instruments OMAP compatible SoC family of
processors.

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/voltdm/voltage_domain.txt

Required Properties:
- compatible: Should be one of:
	"ti,omap-voltdm" - basic voltage domain controlling VDD and VBB
- vdd-supply: phandle to regulator controlling VDD supply
- vbb-supply: phandle to regulator controlling Body Bias supply
  (Usually Adaptive Body Bias regulator)
- #voltdm-cells: shall be <0>

Example:
voltage_domain_mpu: voltdm@1 {
	compatible = "ti,omap-voltdm";
	#voltdm-cells = <0>;

	vdd-supply = <&vcc>;
	vbb-supply = <&abb_mpu>;
};
